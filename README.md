# Interactive Traffic Simulation üöóüåê

Welcome to the **Interactive Traffic Simulation** repository! In this project, you can immerse yourself in a ring-road multi-lane traffic environment. Take control of a car, change lanes, accelerate, and decelerate in real-time. You can even create congestion and observe the dynamics of traffic through time-space diagrams of trajectories.

## Introduction

Traffic simulations are essential for understanding vehicle behavior and traffic flow. This project allows users to experience and manipulate traffic in a controlled environment. You can explore how vehicles interact, how congestion forms, and how stop-and-go waves occur.

## Features

- **Interactive Control**: Take the wheel and control your vehicle's speed and lane position.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Experience live traffic dynamics and changes as you drive.
- **Traffic Visualization**: View time-space diagrams to understand vehicle trajectories and traffic flow.
- **Customizable Settings**: Adjust parameters to simulate different traffic conditions and behaviors.
- **Educational Tool**: Use the simulation for learning about traffic dynamics and vehicle interactions.

## Installation

To get started with the Interactive Traffic Simulation, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nonamebruhyes/interactive_traffic_simulation.git
   cd interactive_traffic_simulation
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/nonamebruhyes/interactive_traffic_simulation/releases) to download the latest version of the simulation. Execute the downloaded file to run the simulation.

## Usage

After installation, you can run the simulation using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

Once the simulation starts, you can control your vehicle using the following keys:

- **Arrow Up**: Accelerate
- **Arrow Down**: Decelerate
- **Arrow Left**: Change to the left lane
- **Arrow Right**: Change to the right lane

You can observe how your actions affect traffic flow and the formation of congestion.

## Understanding Traffic Dynamics

Traffic dynamics can be complex. This simulation aims to simplify and visualize these interactions. Here are some key concepts:

### Car Following

Car following models describe how vehicles maintain a safe distance from one another. The simulation implements basic car-following rules, allowing you to see how your vehicle reacts to those in front.

### Lane Changing

Lane changing is crucial for maintaining smooth traffic flow. In this simulation, you can change lanes and see how it affects surrounding vehicles.

### Congestion

Congestion often occurs due to various factors, including lane changes and sudden stops. The simulation allows you to create and observe congestion in real-time.

### Time-Space Diagrams

These diagrams visualize vehicle trajectories over time. You can generate these diagrams to analyze traffic flow and identify patterns.
